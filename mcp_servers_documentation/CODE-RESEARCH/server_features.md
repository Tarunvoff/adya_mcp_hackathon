# Code Research MCP Server - Server Features

## Overview

The Code Research MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI assistants to intelligently search and retrieve programming knowledge across multiple developer-centric platforms. It provides seamless access to documentation, tutorials, Q&A sites, code repositories, and more, through natural language interaction.

The server supports 13+ specialized search tools, each integrated to enhance coding productivity, learning, and research workflows.

## Core Capabilities

### Search Tool Integrations
Perform comprehensive searches across various developer resources.

*Operations Available:*
- *GitHub Search*: Search repositories, issues, and code snippets.
- *NPM Search*: Retrieve information about JavaScript/Node.js packages.
- *PyPI Search*: Lookup Python packages and their metadata.
- *Stack Overflow Search*: Query programming-related questions and answers.
- *MDN Search*: Access Mozilla Developer Network documentation for web technologies.
- *Search All*: Run a unified search across multiple sources.
- *Rust Crates Search*: Find packages from crates.io for Rust.
- *Go Packages Search*: Retrieve Go package documentation and info.
- *DevDocs Search*: Search the DevDocs.io aggregated documentation.
- *Awesome Lists Search*: Explore curated GitHub Awesome lists.
- *Reddit Programming Search*: Query posts from Reddit programming communities.
- *YouTube Tutorials Search*: Find relevant video tutorials on YouTube.
- *Tech Blogs Search*: Search developer blogs and tech-related articles.

## Technical Architecture

### Command Execution Engine
- Uses the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for building MCP-compatible servers.
- Each tool is modularized into its own file for better maintainability.
- Dynamically registers and loads search tools during server initialization.

### Tool Registration Flow
- All tools are registered via factory functions (create[ToolName]Tool(server)).
- Tools are isolated and follow single responsibility principle.
- Easily extendable by adding new create[ToolName]Tool() functions in the /tools directory.

### Server Transport
- Communication over StdioServerTransport for easy integration into CLI-based AI workflows.

## Authentication & Security

- No credential handling or authentication required for public data retrieval tools.
- Safe execution environment as no command execution or user data access occurs.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js environment
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk installed
- Internet access for API/data retrieval from external services

## Use Cases

### Developer Productivity
- Rapidly search across multiple documentation and code repositories.
- Find reliable tutorials, examples, and packages in real-time.

### Learning & Education
- Access programming references, best practices, and Q&A content.
- Supplement learning with videos and curated resources.

### AI Assistant Tooling
- Integrate into AI systems to augment code generation and error resolution with contextual research tools.
